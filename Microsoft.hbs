                    Microsoft: Company Overview
                </strong><br>
                Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company that has become one of the worldâ€™s most influential and valuable tech firms. Founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft initially gained fame for its operating systems, most notably Windows, which revolutionized the personal computer industry.
            </p >
            <p>
            <strong>Early Years and Evolution</strong><br>
            Microsoft was established in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Gates and Allen developed a version of the BASIC programming language for an early personal computer. However, it was in 1985 when Microsoft made its mark with the release of Windows 1.0, a graphical user interface (GUI) for its MS-DOS operating system. This was the first step in establishing Microsoft as a dominant force in the software industry.</p>

                <strong>
                    Growth and Global Expansion  
                </strong><br>Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft expanded its portfolio beyond operating systems, launching products such as Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software that included Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These tools became essential for businesses and individuals alike, helping to solidify Microsoft's presence in both the personal and business computing sectors.

                The company's continued success in software innovation allowed it to dominate the PC industry for decades. In 2001, Microsoft launched Windows XP, which became one of the most popular operating systems worldwide, renowned for its user-friendly interface and stability.

                <strong>
                    Diversification and New Ventures
                </strong><br>
                As the tech landscape shifted, Microsoft recognized the importance of diversifying its product offerings. In the 2000s and 2010s, Microsoft made major investments in cloud computing, with the introduction of Microsoft Azure, a cloud services platform that directly competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This helped position Microsoft as a leader in cloud technology, catering to businesses and governments looking to store and analyze data securely.

                The company also ventured into hardware, creating the Xbox gaming console and Surface tablets, which competed with Apple's iPad. In 2014, Satya Nadella took over as CEO, ushering in a new era of cloud-first, mobile-first strategies. Under his leadership, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2016 and GitHub in 2018, expanding its reach in social networking and software development tools.
