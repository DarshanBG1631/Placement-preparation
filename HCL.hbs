            <h2>About HCL</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>HCL Technologie</strong>, founded in <strong>1976 by Shiv Nadar</strong>, is a global IT
                services and consulting company headquartered in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. Originally established as
                Hindustan Computers Limited, HCL was one of the pioneers in India's computer industry, introducing the
                country’s first 8-bit microcomputer in 1978. Over the decades, HCL transitioned from hardware
                manufacturing to becoming a leader in software services, IT consulting, and business process
                outsourcing. <br><br>

                The company operates in various sectors, including software development, digital transformation, cloud
                computing, cybersecurity, engineering services, and infrastructure management. It serves clients across

                1), next-generation technology adoption (Mode 2), and exploring innovative products and platforms (Mode
                3). This strategy has been instrumental in helping the company achieve sustained growth and deliver
                value to its clients. <br><br>

                The current CEO and Managing Director of HCL Technologies is <strong>C Vijayakumar</strong>, who took
