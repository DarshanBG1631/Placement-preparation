            <h2 >About L&T</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Larsen & Toubro (L&T) </strong>is an Indian multinational conglomerate that operates in a variety of industries, including engineering, construction, manufacturing, technology, and financial services. Founded in <strong> 1938 by two Danish engineers</strong>, Henning Holck-Larsen and Soren Kristian Toubro, the company initially started as a small trading firm for machinery and equipment used in the country’s burgeoning industrial sector. Over time, L&T expanded its operations into a wide range of sectors, including infrastructure development, defense, power, and IT services, becoming one of India's largest and most diversified companies.
                <br><br>

                The company’s significant early milestones include its involvement in the construction of large-scale infrastructure projects, such as dams, bridges, and factories. L&T was also one of the pioneers in the development of the Indian manufacturing sector, particularly in the production of heavy equipment, steel, and electrical products. The company made significant strides in both the Indian and global markets, eventually becoming known for its strong engineering capabilities, reliable products, and large-scale construction projects.
                <br><br>
                
                L&T’s presence has grown internationally, with its projects spanning across countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. It has been involved in the construction of critical infrastructure, including airports, ports, metro systems, and power plants. Its engineering and construction division is one of the largest in India, and the company has been listed on both the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
                <br><br>
                The company’s growth into a leading technology solutions provider has been largely driven by its subsidiary, L&T Technology Services (LTTS), which focuses on digital solutions, product engineering, and software services. It also has a presence in financial services, with L&T Financial Services offering a range of products in areas such as insurance, mutual funds, and retail finance.
                <br><br>
                
                As of 2024, the CEO and Managing Director of L&T is <strong>S. N. Subrahmanyan</strong>, who has been with the company for many years and has played a significant role in its growth and diversification. He took over as CEO in 2017 and has led the company through a period of technological transformation and expansion in international markets.
                <br><br>
                
                L&T continues to be a symbol of India's industrial prowess and global presence, committed to engineering excellence and innovation.
