            <p>
                <strong>Google</strong> is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products. It
                was founded on <strong>September 4, 1998</strong>, by <strong>Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</strong> "Larry Page" and "Sergey Brin", who were Ph.D. students at
                Stanford University at the time. The company began as a search engine project, aiming to organize and
                make information universally accessible and useful.
                <br><br>

                Google's primary service, the Google Search engine, quickly became the world's most popular search
                engine due to its advanced algorithms and user-friendly interface. Over the years, the company expanded
                its portfolio to include a wide range of services and products, such as "Gmail", "Google Maps",
                "Google Drive", "Google Chrome", and the "Android operating system". It also ventured into

                In 2015, Google underwent a corporate restructuring, becoming a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., a
                conglomerate that serves as the parent company for Google's diverse ventures, including its experimental
                projects like self-driving cars (Waymo) and life sciences research (Verily).

                2004 and played a key role in developing products like Chrome and Android before ascending to the
                leadership position.

                accounting for the majority of its revenue. It has also been a major player in cloud computing through
                Google Cloud and a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) research, contributing to advancements in
                machine learning and AI-powered tools like Google Assistant.

                known for its innovative workplace culture and emphasis on sustainability. Google has faced challenges,
                including regulatory scrutiny over antitrust issues and privacy concerns, but it remains a dominant
                force in the tech industry, impacting billions of people worldwide.
