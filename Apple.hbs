            <p>
                
                <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. It is known for designing, developing, and selling consumer electronics, software, and online services. Apple is one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world, with its innovations shaping the tech industry.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Founding:
                </strong>
                <br>
                Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The three co-founders aimed to create personal computers that were user-friendly and accessible to the general public. The company’s first product was the Apple I, a computer designed by Wozniak and marketed by Jobs. The Apple I was assembled in Jobs’ garage, and though it did not achieve widespread success, it laid the groundwork for future innovations.
                <br><br>
                In 1977, Apple launched its Apple II, one of the first pre-assembled personal computers that saw great success and played a pivotal role in the personal computing revolution. The company's breakthrough continued with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, a computer with a graphical user interface, which distinguished itself from competitors at the time.
                Growth and Challenges:
                <br><br>
                Despite early successes, Apple faced several challenges in the following decades, including leadership changes and struggles to maintain its market position. Steve Jobs was famously ousted from the company in 1985 after internal conflicts, and Apple struggled through the late 1980s and early 1990s with a lack of direction.
                <br><br>
                
                However, Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, leading a revitalization of the company. Under his leadership, Apple transitioned from being a computer company to a consumer electronics powerhouse, launching innovative products like the iPod (2001), the iPhone (2007), and the iPad (2010), which revolutionized the music, smartphone, and tablet industries.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Leadership:</strong>
                <br>
                
                Steve Jobs served as CEO until his passing in 2011. After his death, Tim Cook succeeded him as the CEO. Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, had played a critical role in streamlining Apple’s operations and supply chain before taking the helm. Under Cook’s leadership, Apple continued to expand its product line and services, becoming a leader in various sectors such as wearables, streaming services, and digital payments.
                <br><br>
                
                Today, Apple is known for its innovation, design excellence, and a loyal customer base. It has grown to be one of the most valuable companies in the world, consistently ranking at the top in terms of market capitalization.
